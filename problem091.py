# The Euler Project: problem 091
#
# The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to 
# the origin, O(0,0), to form Î”OPQ.
#
# There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each 
# co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
# 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 2.
